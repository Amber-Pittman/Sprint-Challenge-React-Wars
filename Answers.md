1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

##### ReactJS is a User Interface Component Library that is used to deal with complex state. Originated by engineers at Facebook, they used it to deal with all the different components that make up a single page (all your profile info, tabs to new events, your friends & their posts, the endless scroll newsfeed). They built React to manage all that data without "bogging down" the actual DOM.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

##### It's a concept of thinking about how you want to build your application BEFORE you begin working on your app so that it will become scalable as popularity grows. 

3. Describe state.

##### State is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive. 

4. Describe props.

##### Props is an object - any data we wish to get will be injected as properties on this props object.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

##### Side effects are any intended or unintended result of a function OUTSIDE of scope of a function. You can use `useEffect` for more control of side effects.
